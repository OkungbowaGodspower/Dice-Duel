# Dice Duel

## Introduction

Welcome to Dice Duel, a simple and engaging two-player game of luck and strategy. In Dice Duel, players take turns rolling a six-sided die to accumulate points. The goal is to be the first to reach or exceed a score of 100 points.

## Game Rules

1. **Objective:**
   - The objective of the game is to reach a score of 100 points before your opponent.

2. **Turns:**
   - Players take turns rolling a six-sided die, starting with Player 1.
   - On your turn, you can roll the die as many times as you want to accumulate points.
   - The numbers rolled are added to your current turn's score.

3. **Holding Points:**
   - At any point during your turn, you can choose to "hold" your current turn's score.
   - Holding adds your turn's current score to your total score, and your turn ends.

4. **Switching Turns:**
   - If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends immediately, and they lose all points accumulated during that turn.
   - The dice are then handed over to the other player, and it becomes their turn.

5. **Winning the Game:**
   - The game continues until one player reaches or exceeds 100 points.
   - The first player to achieve this score is declared the winner.

## Game Logic

- Each player starts with a total score of 0.
- During their turn, a player accumulates points by rolling the die.
- If a player rolls a 1, their current turn ends, and they lose all points for that turn.
- Players can choose to "hold" their turn at any point, adding the current turn's score to their total score.
- The dice and turn switch to the other player after a 1 is rolled or the player decides to hold.
- The game continues until one player reaches or exceeds 100 points.
